# MovieBot

## Inspiration
I wanted to learn how to build a chatbot, but my local IDE and environments weren't working so I decided to work on a project on Colab. I came across a chatbot tutorial for Colab, and decided to follow/learn it.

## What it does
MovieBot is a chatbot but only replies to you with movie phrases

## How I built it
Made with help from a [tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XlmtcyMdPRQC6bw2HQYb3UPtVGKqUJ0a#scrollTo=8R0T0ei52FXS), Google Colab, Flask, Spacy, Python, and SimpleNeighbors

## Challenges I ran into
Understanding the theory and math behind semantic similarity and reading the documentation to use updated versions of code

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Finishing my first AI project and understanding the theory behind semantic similarity

## What I learned
The theory behind chatbots, NLP, word and sentence vectors, cleaning/arranging data, etc.

## What's next for MoiveBot
Moviebot is fundamentally a chatbot. If we train the chatbot with customer service data, support data, etc. you automate customer support for your business. Making an API for you to add the chatbot onto your website would also be great.
